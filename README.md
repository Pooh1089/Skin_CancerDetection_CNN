# Skin CancerDetection :

## Objective : 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

# Technology used : 
1. numpy - version 1.21.6
2. matplotlib - version 3.2.2
3. tensorflow - version 2.8
4. PIL- v 7.1.2

# Inferences: 
- The overfitting issue significantly reduced on using drop out layer and data augmentation. 
- The class rebalance helped in increasing the validation accuracy and removinf the overfitting problem.

# Contributions :
This project is done individually. Project owner name is Pooja Ravi Shankar.
